â‰ˆ# IWU Data Science Bootcamp Fall 2019
## Bootcamp 1: Predicting Titanic Survivors with Logistic Regression
In this bootcamp, we'll learn about logistic regression and implement a logistic regression model using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a popular machine learning library in Python. The dataset we'll use is the [Titanic dataset from Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
