# IWU Data Science Bootcamp Fall 2019
## Bootcamp 1: Predicting Titanic Survivors with Logistic Regression
In this bootcamp, we'll learn about logistic regression and implement a logistic regression model using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a popular machine learning library in Python. The dataset we'll use is the [Titanic dataset from Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Bootcamp 2: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
This bootcamp teaches you how to implement a linear regression model to predict house prices. We'll also look into what gradient descent is and how it can be used to find the optimized weights for the model.
